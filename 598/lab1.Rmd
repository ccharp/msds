## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
econseries = read.csv("data/uschange.csv")
consump_ts = ts(econseries$Consumption, freq=4, start=c(1970, 1))
str(consump_ts)
```


```{r}
plot(consump_ts, main="US personal consumption expenditure", ylab="percent change")
```
