A researcher is interested in measurements of a pollutant in water samples. In particular, there is a 
question about whether the value changes if the sample is tested when it is older compared with being 
tested right after it is collected. The researcher suspects that aging could decrease the pollutant 
concentration.  Because testing is typically done after a period of time of storage, there is a concern that 
pollutant concentrations are underestimated. An experiment was done on a set of 15 samples of water 
taken from a lake. Each sample was divided into 2 aliquots, one to be analyzed right away and the other to 
be analyzed 1 month later (the typical delay in analysis). 
Data: pollutant.csv
```{R}
df <- as_tibble(read.csv("../data/pollutant.csv"))
df
```
1. What is the null hypothesis that the researcher should test?
\begin{align*}
H_0: \mu_{fresh} &= \mu_{aged} \\
\end{align*}

2. What is an appropriate alternative hypothesis?
\begin{align*}
H_1: \mu_{fresh} \neq \mu_{aged} \\
\end{align*}

3. What is an appropriate test to use to test the null hypothesis?
```{R}
var.fresh <- var(df$fresh)
var.aged <- var(df$aged)
print(paste0("Sample Variance -- Fresh: ", var.fresh, "; Aged: ", var.aged))
```

4. Calculate the value of the test statistic using a formula presented in class (not an R function).
```{R}
n_fresh = length(df$fresh)
n_aged = length(df$aged)
var_pooled = ((n_fresh - 1)*var.fresh + (n_aged - 1)*var.aged)/(n_fresh + n_aged - 2)
my.se = sqrt(var_pooled/(n_fresh + n_aged))
diff.mean = mean(df$fresh) - mean(df$aged)
t.stat = diff.mean/my.se
t.stat
```

5. Should you reject the null hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05?
```{R}
sig <- qt(0.025, df=length(df$sample))
sig
```
No.

6. Provide the p-value for the test. 
```{R}
2*pt(-t.stat, df=length(df$sample))
```

7. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in concentration between fresh and aged samples. Use a  formula provided in class (not an R function). Do the confidence interval and hypothesis test give the same general conclusions?
```{R}
l.bound <- diff.mean - abs(sig)*my.se
r.bound <- diff.mean + abs(sig)*my.se
paste0("(", l.bound, ", ", r.bound, ")")
```
Yes, 0 falls within the bound. 

8. Perform the test and confidence interval using an R function. Confirm that you get the same results as you obtained using formulas.
```{R}

```

9. After a check on the data, it was determined that the fresh value for sample number 10 was an error due to failure of the measuring equipment that happened to occur at the time of processing this sample. Re-run the analyses with this value excluded. How did the results change? Explain.

10. Suppose that it was determined that the equipment failure seemed to be a random event having nothing to do with the particular sample itself. Which set of results should be reported (i.e., with the last data value included or excluded)?

11. Suppose that in a parallel universe it was determined that the equipment failure might have been caused by an unusual level of pollutant in that sample when it was fresh. Which set of results should be reported in this parallel universe?
